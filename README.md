## About me: 
Ma name is Dorota Trzpil, and I am a software tester. 

For over 10 years, I have worked as a tutor in an Care and Educational Institution, where I have honed my interpersonal skills, ability to work in a team, and patience. During this time, I have gained valuable experience in collaborating with challenging clients.

I made a decision to switch my career path, and have since been steadily acquiring knowledge, skills, and experience in the field of software testing. My focus is on continual development and learning. Presently, I work as a manual tester at Utest and have actively contributed to over 70 projects while maintaining a high rating. Additionally, I participate in voluntary testing projects.
 
My goals are to enhance my qualifications as a manual tester and get to know the field of automation testing.

I would like to invite you to review my repository, where you can gain insight into the development path that I am pursuing and review my sample work.


## REST API testing: 

Here you can find API testing for trello.com website within the scope of boards. I used methods based on CRUD operations and E2E testing.
The collection includes functional and integration tests, as well as contract testing. Both happy paths and error handling was test.
